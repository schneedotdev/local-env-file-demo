# Group A â€” Onboarding to an Existing Project

This project is configured to use **1Password Environments**. Your task is to onboard to the project and get it up and running locally.

## 1. Join the environment

- One participant should act as an admin of the Environment:
  - Create an **Environment** in 1Password.
  - Invite the rest of your team to the Environment.

- Other participants:
  - Confirm you can access the Environment in 1Password.
  - Work with your team to configure the project's secrets and connect to the local database.
  - Confirm the `.env` file generated by 1Password is not tracked by Git.

## 2. Configure the Local `.env` File destination

- Configure a **Local `.env` File** destination pointing to the `group-a` directory.
- Ensure the destination's path is `./.env`.
- Map secrets from the Environment to the variables the app requires.

## 3. Install dependencies

From the `group-a` directory:

```bash
npm install
```

## 4. Run the project

You can now run the project:

```bash
npm start
```

If properly configured, the app will validate that the required secrets are available and simulate connecting to a database. If you're unable to connect to the database, debug with your team.

## Bonus

Consider how you would adopt this setup for one of your own projects or scripts. Attempt to replace your current secrets management solution with an Environment.
