# 1Password Environments â€” Bug Bash

Welcome to the bug bash! ðŸŽ‰  

In this exercise, youâ€™ll be hands-on with the new **Local `.env` file** destination available in beta for **1Password Environments**. This new destination eliminates a common risk and frustration developers face: **secrets stored in plaintext `.env` files that are hard to share and easy to leak.**

With our new workflow:  
- Developers can keep using `.env` files on their devices.
- Secrets are securely managed in 1Password.
- Secrets are delivered only when neededâ€”and never written to disk.

Youâ€™ll explore the new destination in two common scenarios:

| Group | Scenario | Story |
| - | - | - |
| A | Onboarding to an existing project | I want to clone my teamâ€™s project, access itâ€™s secrets from within 1Password, and complete the configuration steps needed to get up and running locally. |
| B | Replacing an existing `.env` file | I want to adopt Environments for my personal project, replacing existing `.env` files that held Secret References or plaintext secrets with one managed by 1Password. |

## Quick start
